It wasn't always smooth sailing, but I'm enjoying building with Astro. And, the [Discord community](https://astro.build/chat) is really friendly and helpful!

Thank you for the opportunity to serve you.  Since 2019, GPM Health and Life Insurance Company has had the privilege of being your Medicare Supplement Insurance provider.  We are sincerely grateful to have you as our customer.

Premium adjustments are never welcomed news and we do not take such actions lightly.  Adjustments are implemented only after careful consideration.  Medicare supplement insurance premiums can abe impacted by a combination of influences, including age and the increased cost in covering claims expenses to name just a few.

As these conditions change, insurers need to make adjustments accordingly.  Your benefits will not change as a result of this adjustment.  Your premium is changing because of the increased cost of healthcare.  In addition your policy calls for periodic increases based on age.

Effective November 1, 2024, your Medicare supplement monthly premium will be $276.61.

This information is for your records and does not require any changes.  Your payment method remains the same as it is today.

We strive to provide you with outstanding customer service.  In fact, we proudly process more than 98% of claims within 24 hours of receiving them from Medicare.

If you have any questions we are just a phone call away.  Please do not hesitate to contact us at the number below.
